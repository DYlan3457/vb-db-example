This application is a part of a review management application for users to review coffee shops. It stores coffee shops, users, and reviews in database tables. 

In the application, you can view any of the three tables.

You can create a new user, review, and coffee shop.
These use parameterized SQL queries which are *very* important. (see SQL injection demo application in class)

You can display all of the coffee shops together with all of their reviews (which uses a SQL Join).
